# rhizosphere-copiotrophs
This is where scripts from Lopez et al. 2022 paper on rhizosphere and copiotrophs association are stored. 
Microbiota ðŸ¦  living in close association with plants present some general characteristics despite its taxonomy: microbes colonizing roots grow faster than those inhabiting their soils. We analyzed 16s metagenomic data and revealed this pattern, using samples from rhizospheres in different plants and their associated bulk soils.
