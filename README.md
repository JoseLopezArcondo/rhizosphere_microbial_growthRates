# rhizosphere_microbial_growthRates
This is where scripts from Lopez et al. 2022 paper on rhizosphere and copiotrophs association are stored 

Microbiota ðŸ¦  living in close association with plants roots are diverse and can be neutral, pathogenic or beneficial to their host. The rhizobiome assembly is complex and depends of root exudates to establish. The change in microbiome composition between soil bacteria and rhizosphere bacteria is called "rhizosphere effect", and some factors governing this process include the plant species, environmental conditions such as light cycle or drought. However, we showed here for the first time that the most relevant factor determining the rhizosphere effect is growth rate, i.e. microbes colonizing roots grow faster than those inhabiting their soils.
